    SUHF Attributes:
        X: 
            transformation matrix (regular AO -> orthonormal AO)
            It's asymmetric, as X in G09
        nbeta: number of grids for beta
        grids: integration grids for beta
        weights:
        d_expr: SymPy expr for Wigner d 
        d_func: NumPy function for Wigner d
        d     : array
            current values of Wigner d, on given grids
